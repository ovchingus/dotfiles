# dotfiles

This repo contains my dotfile configuration, allowing for a consistent computing experience across multiple machines.
These days I primarily use GNU/Linux via the [Arch Linux distribution](https://archlinux.org).

I manage the various configuration files in this repo using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). This allows me to set up symlinks for all of my dotfiles using a single command:

```sh
stow .
```

- Inspiration

The inspiration for this configuration comes from the [dotfiles by daviwil](https://github.com/daviwil/dotfiles). If you're looking for inspiration to create your own emacs configuration, or improve your system configuration synchronisation, then I'd suggest watching his videos.
